# Rate-Limiters

This repository contains a simple implementation of different rate limiting algorithms such as bucket token algorithm.

### - Bucket token algorithm:
has been implemented based on https://engineering.classdojo.com/blog/2015/02/06/rolling-rate-limiter/ approach to make the algorithm more efficient.
